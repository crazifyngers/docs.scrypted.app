# Record Cameras

## Camera Setup

1. [Configure the Camera](/camera-preparation).
2. [Add the Camera to Scrypted](/add-camera.md).
3. [Verify the Motion Sensor](/camera-validation) is working. Scrypted waits for the camera to report motion to trigger video analysis. 
:::warning
If the Camera's Motion Sensor is disabled, detections will be unavailable on the NVR timeline.
:::
4. Enable Recording in the Camera Settings by selecting `Scrypted NVR` in the `Integrations and Extensions` list.

## Cameras and Recordings

After the Scrypted NVR Plugin has been installed, `Cameras and Recordings` can be viewed on your local network by visiting the address of this Scrypted server.

Cloud access must be enabled for remote access via [browser, iOS, Android, and Desktop Apps](apps).
